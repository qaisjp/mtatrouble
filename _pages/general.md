If you are having problems starting MTA try the following:

1. Check GTA:SA works in single player mode:
    a) Start GTA:SA by double clicking on its icon, or the `gta_sa.exe` file which is usually found in one of these locations:
    
    - `C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas\gta_sa.exe`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas\gta_sa.exe`

    b) If GTA:SA does not work, delete the GTA:SA settings file from your documents folder:

    - `Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files\gta\sa.set`

    c) If GTA:SA still does not work, reinstall GTA:SA

2. If GTA:SA works ok, try installing MTA to a new directory.

    a) Download and install the lastest stable MTA version from here:

      [Download latest stable version of MTA](https://www.multitheftauto.com/)

    b) During the install, change the default install directory to something unique i.e.

        "C:\Program Files\MTA San Andreas copy"

3. Try the latest patch.

    a) Download and install from here:

      [Download patch for MTA](https://www.multitheftauto.com/)

4. Try installing Microsoft runtime components.
