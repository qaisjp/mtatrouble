# updatesa

A version of https://github.com/sbx320/mtatrouble that was created on 24 Apr 17:43.

This one _also_ supports:

- backwards compatibility with existing links: https://trouble.qais.dev/?tr=general redirects to `/general`
- support for auto-Google-translation + prevents tokens that should never be translated from being translated (`MTA:SA`, `GTA:SA`, etc.)
- full list of pages: https://trouble.qais.dev/all
- shitty css
